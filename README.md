## Get Start ðŸŒŸ

### Contribute

-   Clone the repo by typing this commands:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ayush0431/aicte.git
    ```
-   Now after cloning, if you observe your folders there will be no node_modules without which your react-app won't run so first of all  do following steps.

### Environment Setup

1. Run the following command to install all the required packages to run the project:

```
    npm install
```

OR

```
    yarn install
```

3. To run the project server:

```
    yarn start
```

OR

```
    npm run start
```
-   when done with the code part:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "<what_you_have_contributed>"
    ```
- Now before pushing the code make sure you are pushing the code on your branch if you don't have any branch you can create using following command.    
    ```bash
    git branch <whatever_branch_name_you_like>
    ```
- Now for switching the branch you can use following command
  ```bash
  git checkout <your_branch_name>
  ```
- now if you want to check on which branch you are you can run(optional):
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```
- now, if you see the branch name that you just created in green color means everything is fine. now push the code to your branch using:
  ```branch
  git push
  ```
- above command won't work first time because the branch that you just created is not set as upstream so run below command:
  ```bash
  git push --set-upstream origin <your_branch_name>
  ```
- now onwards you can directly use <code>git push</code>, just make sure you are in your branch and you know how to check it ðŸ˜‰.

-   REPEAT...

### Prerequisites

-   GIT, NPM/Yarn
-   Install yarn by executing : `npm install -g yarn@latest`
